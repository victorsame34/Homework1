            Going travelling is one of the few things we undertake in a direct attempt to make ourselves happy – and
            frequently, in fascinating ways, we fail. We get bored, cross, anxious or lonely. It isn’t surprising our
            societies act as if going travelling were simple, just a case of handing over the right sum of money. But a
            satisfying journey isn’t something we can simply buy: it’s the result of an art that has to be learnt.
